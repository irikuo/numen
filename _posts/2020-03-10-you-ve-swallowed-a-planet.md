Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself. Saving the world with meals on wheels. **Father Christmas.** _Santa Claus._ Or as I've always known him: Jeff.

## You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

1. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
2. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?
3. Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

### Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

_Insistently_ Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Saving the world with meals on wheels. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool.

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why.

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. You hit me with a cricket bat. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!

You hit me with a cricket bat. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today.

Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. _Insistently_ Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.
